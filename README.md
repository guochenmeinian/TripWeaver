# TripWeaver 🌍

**TripWeaver** is a travel planning assistant built with Google ADK (Agent Development Kit). It supports basic natural language input and uses a root agent to route user queries.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/guochenmeinian/TripWeaver.git
cd TripWeaver
```

2. Install dependencies (python 3.12 required):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run with ADK:

```
adk web
```

## 📝 Notes

This is an MVP using ADK’s default web frontend. Future features include itinerary planning, booking, preference tracking, and memory integration.
